Imagine using camelCase for everything in python.

Generates storyboard Sample code based on input midi or Mapping Tools .json (may or may not break if it has other hitsounds than midi imported ones). 

Currently reads all midi tracks as one. hitsound samples are expected to have the note (C1, F#6, etc) in the filename, and all samples should be in the same folder.


Length rounding roughness based on Mapping Tools, so this should Generate similar results.
